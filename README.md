# LibraryManagementSystem
The “LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”
process made computerized to reduce human errors and to increase
the efficiency. The main focus of this project is to lessen human
efforts. The maintenance of the records is made efficient, as all the
records are stored in the SQLite database, through which data can be
retrieved easily. The editing is also made simpler. The user has to just
type in the required field and update the desired field. Our main aim of
the project is to get the correct information about a particular student
and books available in the library. The problems, which existed, have
been removed to a large extent. And it is expected that this project will go
a long way in satisfying user’s requirements. The computerization of the
Library Management will not only improve the efficiency but will also
reduce human stress thereby indirectly improving human resources.
